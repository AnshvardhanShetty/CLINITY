## CLINICAL SNAPSHOT

**Active Problems:**

1.  Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) - Stage 4 CKD.
2.  Heart Failure (HFrEF).
3.  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
4.  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).
5.  Atrial Fibrillation (AF).
6.  Hypertension (HTN).
7.  Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) - post cardiac stents.
8.  Liver Cancer (HCC) - on immunotherapy.
9.  Left Eye Cancer (LEC) - proton beam therapy.
10. Obesity (BMI).
11. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).
12. Limb Ischemia (RIK).

**Current Status:**

Jennifer Morrison is a 68-year-old female admitted to the hospital with a history of multiple medical conditions, including AKI, heart failure, COPD, T2DM, AF, HTN, IHD, HCC, LEC, obesity, OSA, RIK, and recent MI. She was admitted from A&E with a history of SOB, dry cough, and fever. She was found to be lethargic and fell from a chair onto the floor, resulting in a low blood pressure of 68/35, requiring intubation. She is currently on arterial and central venous catheters.

**Pending Actions:**

*   HbA1c (expected later today).
*   Urine culture sensitivities (final).

**Risks & Safety Concerns:**

*   Allergies: Nicorotime, Rampril.
*   Risk of complications related to AKI, heart failure, and COPD.
*   Risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation (pending INR result).
