Ward Round - 18/01/2026
Dr. Patel

Mrs. Jennifer Morrison, 67F, Bed 12, Day 3 of admission

Presenting complaint: Collapse at home, found by daughter

Background:
- T2DM (on metformin, gliclazide)
- Hypertension
- CKD stage 3b (baseline Cr ~150)
- Previous TIA 2024
- Osteoarthritis both knees

Admission summary:
Found on floor by daughter, unclear how long. GCS 14 on arrival (E3V5M6), now GCS 15. CT head: no acute intracranial pathology. ?Hypoglycaemic episode vs mechanical fall vs cardiac cause.

Current issues:
1. Collapse ?cause - hypoglycaemia most likely given BM 2.1 on arrival. Gliclazide held. HbA1c pending.
2. AKI on CKD - Cr 210 today (baseline 150), improved from 245 on admission. Likely pre-renal, responding to fluids.
3. UTI - MSU grew E. coli >10^5, sensitive to trimethoprim. Started trimethoprim 200mg BD day 2.
4. New AF noted on telemetry - rate controlled (HR 70-80s), not anticoagulated yet given recent fall. Needs CHADSVASC assessment.
5. Mobility - pre-morbid independent with stick. Now requiring frame. PT/OT assessing.

Examination:
Alert, orientated. HR 76 irregular, BP 138/82. Chest clear. Abdo soft. Peripheral oedema 1+ bilaterally. Neuro: no focal deficit.

Investigations:
- Bloods today: Hb 108, WBC 11.2, Plt 234, Na 139, K 4.8, Cr 210, CRP 45 (down from 89)
- ECG: AF, rate 74, no ischaemic changes
- Echo requested - not done yet
- HbA1c pending

Plan:
1. Continue IV fluids, target UO >0.5ml/kg/hr
2. Recheck U&E tomorrow
3. Complete 5 day course trimethoprim (day 3/5)
4. Keep gliclazide held, monitor BMs QDS, sliding scale if needed
5. Chase echo - need to assess LV function before considering anticoagulation
6. CHADSVASC = 5 (age, female, HTN, DM, vascular disease) - will need anticoagulation if no contraindication
7. PT/OT to continue rehab assessment
8. Daughter to attend family meeting tomorrow 2pm - discuss discharge planning

Risks:
- Fall risk - bed rails, 1:1 supervision when mobilising
- Bleeding risk if anticoagulated given recent fall
- Hypoglycaemia risk - close BM monitoring

Outstanding:
- Echo
- HbA1c result
- Family meeting tomorrow
- OT home assessment may be needed
